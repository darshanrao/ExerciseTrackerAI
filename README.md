AlignAI is a mobile fitness application that utilizes TensorFLows pose estimation model to determine if a user is doing a specified exercise correctly based on their body alignment.

The Flutter app was built in 48 hours for Hack Western, a digital Hackathon. Check out the full app demo [here](https://youtu.be/qTkxSWIwJk8)

Since this was built in only 48 hours the code is certainly not perfect, but it works and I'll be improving it in the future!
